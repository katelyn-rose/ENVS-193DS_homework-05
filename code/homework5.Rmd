# Methods
Species

a. Sampling methods (these should be summarized from the metadata and cited)

b. Description of data organization and processing (1-3 sentences)

c. We began by creating a visualization of the missing data in our entire dataset (Figure 1). 
Visualization of missing observations with an accompanying caption and discussion
(caption: 1-3 sentences, discussion: 1-3 sentences)

d. In order to determine the relationships between numerical variables in our dataset, we calculated Pearson's r and visually represented correlation using a correlation plot (Figure 2).
"Visualization of Pearsonâ€™s correlation between variables with an accompanying
caption and discussion (caption: 1-3 sentences, discussion: 1-3 sentences)

e. Visualization of relationships between variables (not correlation) with an
accompanying caption and discussion (caption: 1-3 sentences, discussion: 1-3
sentences)

f. Creating the null and full model with accompanying discussion (1-3 sentences)
g. Visual and statistical assumption checks for the full model with accompanying
discussion (1-3 sentences)

h. Explanation of any transformation and justification (1-3 sentences)

i. Model construction with visual and statistical assumption checks for three
additional models with justification (i.e. why did you choose those predictor
variables?) (justification: 1-3 sentences per model)

j. Variance inflation factor check for the full model with accompanying discussion
(discussion: 1-3 sentences)

k. Model comparison using the null model, full model, and additional models from part
